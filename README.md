# AJAX APP ASSIGNMENT

This repo is for the AJAX App assignment, a continuation of the Earbuds Promotional Page project. The goal of this assignment is to integrate various concepts learned so far, including SASS, AJAX, the template element, and the Fetch API, to create a dynamic and interactive Earbuds Model Page. Students will retrieve information from a provided API link, which outputs data in JSON format, and use the Fetch API to load this data dynamically. The application will update the page view in real time as users interact with the hotspots, showcasing the functionality and responsiveness of the completed app.
